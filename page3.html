            <h3 class="sub-heading">Outside Promises of <span class="treaty-1">Treaty 1</span></h3>
            <p>There were many terms of the Treaty that weren't fulfilled. These terms are called "Outside Promises". The Crown was required to provide 
                clothing, animals, and tools for farming to the Indigenous people. In February of 1872, when these provisions were still not given, the 
                Indigenous people complained of how the Crown was not loyal to the Treaty. When Archibald found out, he blamed Commissioner Simpson, as was 
                responsible for not giving the promised items. This problem was later solved when Simpson got replaced by Joseph Provencher as the new Indian Commissioner. 
                On April 30 of 1875, the issue was solved and everyone got the things they were promised. Additionally, the gratuity increased from 3 dollars to five, 
                and the chief would also get 20 dollars.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">How <span class="treaty-1">Treaty 1</span> is different from other Treaties in Canada</h3>
            <p>Treaty 1 is different from other Treaties in many ways. Firstly, Treaty 1 is focused on the exchanging of land and tools. It doesn't state specific activities 
                or rights the Indigenous people had on those lands. Other Treaties focus on hunting and fishing rights, while Treaty 1 was for education, land, and other provisions. Another way 
                Treaty 1 is different from other Treaties is the geographical size. Some Treaties have a larger area, covering many provinces. Treaty 1 only affects the majority of 
                Southern Manitoba.</p>

            <h3 class="sub-heading">How <span class="treaty-1">Treaty 1</span> is Being Implemented Today</h3>

            <p>After all that has happened, we acknowledge that Treaty 1 wasn't the best agreement, due to the lack of understanding 
                between both parties. In 2006, commissions were set up to understand the relations of activities and 
                historic treaties. Today, the education of Treaty 1 is being implemented in our schools, businesses, and economies. Everyday we 
                acknowledge the land of Treaty 1, it's people, and how it's resources are given to us. This reconciliation is 
                all for the better relationships between the people.</p>
